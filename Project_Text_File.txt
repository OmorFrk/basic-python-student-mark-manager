Student Marks Manager 
Question: 
Write a program to manage student marks. The program should: 
● Allow users to add, view, and update marks for students (name, subject, and score). 
● Calculate the average score for each student. 
● Save student details to a text file for persistence. 
● Use OOP to manage students and marks. 

# A list to save student information
# Each student info will be saved as dictionary & the dictionary will be saved in list.
# We'll create a class named "student"
  in the class some functions to add, update & calculate average
# A continuous loop will run to run menu.
# A menu will be shown to select option.
# Choice from the menu will then be stored in a variable called 'choice'
# According to choice value we'll call regarding functions
# if user selects option 1 (Add or Update):
      we'll take name, subject & score, call the function add or update
# if user selects option 2 (View):
      we'll take only name & show information by calling view function
# break loop after completion

def view_students(students):
  """Displays all student information."""
  if not students:
    print("No students found.")
  else:
    for student in students:
      print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Subject: {student['subject']}, Score: {student['score']}")
my_file = open("StudentInfo.txt", "r") 
data = my_file.read() 
students = data.split("\n") 
my_file.close() 

def calculate_average(students):
  name = input("Enter student name: ")
  student_list = []
  for student in students:
    if student["name"].lower() == name.lower():
      student_list.append(student["score"])
  return sum(student_list)/len(student_list)
